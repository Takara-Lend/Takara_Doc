# Tier/NFT

Tiers represent the level of positions a user holds on Takara. The more positions users maintain, the higher their tiers.

The tiers, from lowest to highest, are: _Takara Wanderer_, _Takara Pioneer_, _Takara Seeker_, _Takara Conqueror_, and _Takara Legend_.

Higher tiers will grant greater benefits within the Takara ecosystem in the future. Additional tier-related features will be revealed soon.

The NFT functionality is not yet available â€” stay tuned for updates.
